Data-driven multiscale simulation of solid-state batteries via deep learning:
Here you can find the large chemo-mechanical simulation datasets at the microscale in solid-state batteries. Beside the python code to train a deep learning model to predict the microscopic behavior by using these data set as well as the saved DL model are provided. The models and python scripts shown here are for three different ranges of -log(-J*)<2, 1.6<-log(-J*)<3.02 and -log(-J*)>2.5. The ovelappings between the ranges are to get better prediction for the cases near the borders.
